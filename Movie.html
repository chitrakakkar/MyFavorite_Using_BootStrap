        <span id ="Movie-name"><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_%22The_Eagle%22_Edwards" >Eddie the Eagle</a></span> is a 2016 biographical sports comedy-drama film directed by Dexter Fletcher.The film stars Taron Egerton as Eddie Edwards, a British skier who in 1988 became the first competitor to represent Great Britain in Olympic ski jumping.Hugh Jackman, Christopher Walken, Iris Berben and Jim Broadbent co-star. The film had its world premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2016.
        Edwards was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. His family call him by his given name, "Michael". "Eddie" is a nickname derived by schoolfriends from his surname.[2] A good downhill skier, he narrowly missed the Great Britain team for that event for the 1984 Games. To improve his chances to qualify for Calgary in 1988, he moved to Lake Placid, New York in the U.S. to train and enter races of a higher standard, but he quickly found himself short on funds.
        In 1973, ten-year-old Eddie Edwards dreams of Olympic glory, practicing in various Olympic events and failing miserably. His mother unconditionally supports him, while his father constantly discourages him. As a young teen, he gives up his dream of participating in the Summer Games in favour of skiing in the Winter Games. Although successful at the sport, he is rejected by British Olympic officials for being uncouth.
        Realizing he could make the team as a ski jumper (a sport in which the United Kingdom had not participated in six decades), he decamps to a training facility in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The more seasoned jumpers, specifically those on the Norwegian team, belittle him.
