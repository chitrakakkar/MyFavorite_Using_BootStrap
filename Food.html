        Stir-fries don't have to mean just vegetables and rice — they can mean noodles, too! In fact, noodle stir-fries are one of my favorite weeknight comfort foods. Whether made with lo mein noodles or rice noodles, these stir-fries are quick to prepare, and serve as the perfect backdrop for everything from sliced chicken breast to tender bok choy.
        Stir Fried noodles are common throughout East and Southeast Asia. Many varieties, cooking styles, and ingredients exist.
        Hong Kong–style dish consisting of flour noodles pan–fried until crispy, and served together with vegetables, chicken, and/or seafood.
